# TradeOffs:
# 1. Framework vs library:
    a. Angular has many options build in and features - React based on your need you can add them
# 2. Concise vs Explicit: 
    a. Angular has two way binding, React has one way binding so little extra code is required but it makes code clear
# 3. Template vs Javascript centric:
    a. Angular uses special syntax like *ngIf, *NgFor - React uses Js like &&
# 4. Separate vs Single file:
    a. Angular uses .html, .css, .ts file - React can use html and javascript in same single file
# 5. Standard vs Non-Standard
    a. Seperation of concerns like files are not maintained in React
# 6. Community vs Corporate

# Why not react:
# HTML and JSX difference
